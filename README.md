# Equilibrium

Lightweight library for easily building ASP.NET Core web applications through a series of custom reusable components 
using a combination of .NET Components & Tag Helpers, native model binding functionalities, SCSS and Vanilla Javascript.

This library is a work-in-progress based on the solutions I find in my daily work, but I'm happily open to suggestions and contributions.
